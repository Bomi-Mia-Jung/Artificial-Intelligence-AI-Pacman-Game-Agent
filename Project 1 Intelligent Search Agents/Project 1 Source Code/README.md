This project extends the AI Pacman Project developed by U.C. Berkely. Attribution to their website here: http://ai.berkeley.edu.

Due to the fact that Berkely asks those who use and extend their projects to NOT publish solutions, 

I have only included the source code I used, as well as video clips of my implemented and trained AI agents in action.
