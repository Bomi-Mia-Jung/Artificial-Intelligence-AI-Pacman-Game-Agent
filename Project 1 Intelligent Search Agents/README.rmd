## Project 1: Intelligent Search Algorithms
Starting out with basic search algorithms such as BFS (breadth-first search), DFS (depth-first search), and UCS (uniform cost search), 
I ultimately built up to implementing an intelligent search algorithm, A* (A-Star), and designed a non-trivial and consistent heuristic 
(one that combines multiple heuristics appropriately) to incorporate domain knowledge into the Pacman Agent's search through the maze to collect food pellets.
