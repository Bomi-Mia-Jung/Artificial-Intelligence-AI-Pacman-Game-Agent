NOTE: My implementations / solutions are NOT included. 

This project implements and extends the AI Pacman Project developed by U.C. Berkely. (Attribution to their website here: http://ai.berkeley.edu.)

Due to the fact that they asks those who use and extend their project to not publish solutions/implementations to their pacman projects, I only uploaded the source code as well as video clips of my implemented and trained AI agents in action in this repo!
