# Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Pacman-Game-Agent
This repo contains my journey of implementing and training Artificially Intelligent Pacman Game Agents using Python. 

This project extends the AI Pacman Project developed by U.C. Berkely. 
Attribution to their website here: http://ai.berkeley.edu.

Due to the fact that Berkely asks those who use and extend their project to NOT publish solutions/implementations to their pacman projects, 
I have only included the source code as well as video clips of my implemented and trained AI agents in action.

## Project 1: Intelligent Search Algorithms
Starting out with basic search algorithms such as BFS (breadth-first search), DFS (depth-first search), and UCS (uniform cost search), 
I ultimately built up to implementing an intelligent search algorithm, A* (A-Star), and designed a non-trivial and consistent heuristic 
(one that combines multiple heuristics appropriately) to incorporate domain knowledge into the Pacman Agent's search through the maze to collect food pellets.
