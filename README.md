# Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Pacman-Game-Agent
This repo contains my journey of implementing and training Artificially Intelligent Pacman Game Agents using Python. 

This project extends the AI Pacman Project developed by U.C. Berkely. Attribution to their website here: http://ai.berkeley.edu.

Due to the fact that Berkely asks those who use and extend their projects to NOT publish solutions, 
I have only included the source code I used, as well as video clips of my implemented and trained AI agents in action.

  Licensing Information:  You are free to use or extend these projects for educational purposes provided that 
  (1) you do not distribute or publish solutions, (2) you retain this notice, and (3) you provide clear

  Attribution Information: The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley.
  The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu).
  Student-side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).


## Project 1: Intelligent Search Algorithms
Starting out with basic search algorithms such as BFS (breadth-first search), DFS (depth-first search), and UCS (uniform cost search), 
I ultimately built up to implementing an intelligent search algorithm, A* (A-Star), and designed a non-trivial and consistent heuristic 
(one that combines multiple heuristics appropriately) to incorporate domain knowledge into the Pacman Agent's search through the maze to collect food pellets.
